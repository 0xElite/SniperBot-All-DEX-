A bot written in Python to automatically buy tokens on the Binance Smart Chain as soon as liquidity is provided. • BSCMultiScan - automatically detects new tokens as soon as liquidity is added. It will check if it is not a scam and honeypot and if not bot will buy it. It will then monitor the price of the token and auto sell at the specified profit margin (eg. 1.5x, 2x, 10x etc). • BSCSpecificScan - allows you to snipe new token launches paired with any token (eg. BNB, BUSD). It has the ability to mempool snipe and will instantly buy when liquidity is added. It constantly updates the price and shows you the profit you've made, has the ability to autosell at a specified profit margin (eg, 2x, 10x etc). By avoiding web interfaces & Metamask and directly with nodes you can snipe tokens faster than any of the web-based platforms. This allows tokens to be sniped almost instantly. During our testing we found the bot would typically be within the first 3 buy transactions of all tokens it finds. The bot buys the tokens using the user's wallet address and private key. This information is kept secure, is only stored locally on your computer, and is only ever used to buy tokens. The bot does not incur any additional fees except  fees are BSC network transaction fees and PancakeSwap fees. The bot's source code is heavily obfuscated and compiled to prevent people stealing code and scammers trying to bypass this system as this has happened before. If you have concerns about the security of this bot then you should create a new wallet with a small amount of BNB and use that wallet's details in the config file. If you make a profit then that can be transferred to your main wallet.
